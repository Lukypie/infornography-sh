# infornography-sh

sh version of infornography; a simple tool to get some info about the runnning os, with a fancy ascii art
tested on linux, with various shells; should work on other unices too (at least on the BSDs)

the ascii art was created with [jp2a](https://csl.name/jp2a/) (little hand changes), using

`jp2a --height=24 --chars=" .xo@@" lain.jpg`

# todo
